# rlvgl-bsps-stm ðŸ†•
Package: `rlvgl-bsps-stm` ðŸ†•

Board support package stubs for STM32 boards used by `rlvgl-creator` ðŸ†•.
The legacy `board` overlay path is kept for compatibility but is deprecated.
This crate now includes simple modules generated from CubeMX `.ioc`
files with basic pin mappings.

Regenerate the stubs with `scripts/gen_ioc_bsps.sh`. The script invokes
`rlvgl-creator` ðŸ†• for every `.ioc` under
`chips/stm/STM32_open_pin_data/boards` and writes the modules to
`chips/stm/bsps/src`. MCU data comes from the bundled `rlvgl-chips-stm`
archive, so no separate `mcu.json` is needed.

## Unsupported devices (partial)

The following boards are known to be unsupported or require vendor
crates that are not yet integrated. They are skipped by the BSP
generation script.

- `stm32-n6`
- `stm32-u0`
- `stm32-u5`
- `stm32wba65i_dk1`

*This list of unsupported devices is not complete; other boards in the
archive may also fail to build.*
